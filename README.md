# Pros and Cons of TDD

## Pros
One benefit of TDD is that the testing process is not rushed or even skipped. With TDD, the test is written before the production code. This means that there will always be test cases to QA check your code and issues will be detected early on. This helps better isolate issues and helps in the debugging process. Another benefit is that TDD will lead to better code quality and fewer bugs. Since the testing process isn't rushed, more thought and consideration can be put in.

## Cons
One drawback of TDD is that less time is put in writing production code. For tight deadlines, following TDD may result in unfinished production code.
